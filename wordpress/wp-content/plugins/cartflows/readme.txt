See the features that make CartFlows the **Best Funnel Builder for WordPress**.

* **Ready to Import Templates:**
Choose from a wide variety of high converting templates. You can add a professionally crafted, multistep funnel, with one mouse click or you can build your own funnel and choose individual templates.

* **Use Your Page Builder:**
CartFlows will work with all popular page builders, and soon Gutenberg. We will offer templates for Beaver Builder, Elementor, Divi, & Thrive Architect. However, you can use CartFlows with your own templates and your own builder.

* **Conversion Tested Checkout:**
CartFlows replaces your complicated checkout process with our optimized checkout that instantly increases conversions, making you more money.

Your buyer's journey doesn't end after checkout. With CartFlows and our custom thank you page feature, you can guild your new customer on their next steps.

* **WooCommerce Checkout Page Replacement**
Say goodbye to using the same ridged checkout page that everyone else is using. Create the perfect WooCommerce checkout page and assign it to be the default WooCommerce checkout template.

### Why is CartFlows such a game-changer? ###

* **Sales Funnel Tools Are Expensive** — Most sales funnel tools carry a hefty monthly fee from $97 - $297 per month, and they are worth every penny because funnels work. With CartFlows you can unleash the power of funnels for free.

* **Sales Funnel Tools Are Complicated** — Most sales funnel tools are frustrating to use. You are stuck using their clunky page builder and have to go through an entirely new learning curve. Who has time for that? With CartFlows you will feel right at home.

* **Sales Funnel Tools Are Closed** — Perhaps the worst part of using other funnel builder tools is they are based on a closed platform that limits you in every way. CartFlows is open and sits on top of WordPress and WooCommerce.

* **Sales Funnel Tools Lock You In** — We believe in using a platform where everything is on your domain, and you control all your data. CartFlows puts you in control and in the driver's seat.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does CartFlows work with my theme? =

Great question. While we haven't tested every WordPress theme, CartFlows was designed to work with all themes because we disable the header and footer on all funnel steps. If you do run into any issues with your particulate theme, our support will be happy to get it resolved for you.

= Does CartFlows work with my page builder? =

CartFlows should work with all page builders. We do provide templates for the most popular page builders, but you can just as easily use your own designs with your favorite page builder.

= Does CartFlows work with the Facebook pixel? =

Each step has an area to add any custom script. CartFlows also integrates with the free Pixel Caffeine and PixelYourSitePro.

= Does CartFlows work with my payment gateway? =

A good rule of thumb is, if it works with WooCommerce, it will work with CartFlows.

= Is there a Pro version of CartFlows? =

Glad you asked! CartFlows Pro is an optional add-on to CartFlows that adds additional checkout styles, checkout field control, order bumps, one-click upsells / downsells, quantity changer, variable product selector, pro templates, training, and more.

= How Many Sales Funnels Can I Make With CartFlows? =
Glad you asked! Most normal users have less than 3 funnels on a single website, so we felt that it is the perfect number for CartFlows. Power users may need more than 3, so in CartFlows Pro, you can have unlimited funnels. As well as additional checkout styles, checkout field control, order bumps, one-click upsells / downsells, quantity changer, variable product selector, pro templates, training, and more.

== Screenshots ==

1. Add "done for you" funnels to your website with 1 click.
2. Drag and drop interface to reorder your funnel steps.
3. Add products to the checkout form and choose your color and fonts.
4. Beautiful, on brand, checkout pages that eliminate distractions and increase conversions.
5. Easily edit anything with your page builder.

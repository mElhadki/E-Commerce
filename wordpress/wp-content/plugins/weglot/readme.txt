== Frequently Asked Questions ==


= Is Weglot Translate free? =

Anyone can try Weglot Translate free for 10 days.


= Edit my translations =

With Weglot Translate, you can modify translations under the « Translations » tab in your Weglot account, [here](https://dashboard.weglot.com/translations/). If you change a translation, it’s automatically saved and displayed on your website.


= The translations I edited are not displayed on my website =

All translations edited in your dashboard are automatically displayed in real-time on the translated versions of your website. If you can not see your new translations:

1. Clear your cache plugin: it will enable new translations to be properly displayed. If your new translations still don’t show up, then:
2. Go into your Weglot account and check you edited the right translations. Use the search bar (at the top) to easily find the translations you want to edit. It’s possible that you have 2 very similar translations, and may have simply edited the wrong one.


= Change the appearance of the Weglot Translate language button =

You can change any of the three pre-set button parameters in your Weglot Translate settings (display/don’t display flags, horizontal or dropdown menu, full language name or 2-letter code), or overwrite the CSS with personalized settings.


= Change the position of the Weglot Translate language button =

* With widget areas, you can drag and drop the Weglot Translate widget.
* Alternatively, you can overwrite the existing CSS to change the Weglot Translate button position or ask the Weglot Translate team at support@weglot.com. We will help you.
* You can also put the button in your site’s navigation menu by checking the option in the Weglot settings page. Be aware that putting the button in the menu might change the appearance of the button a bit, as there are already some style (CSS) rules active in the menu.
* You can additionally use a shortcode: [weglot_switcher]
* Finally, you can also add <div id="weglot_here"></div> anywhere in your code and a Weglot button will be positioned at this location.


= SEO and translations =

Weglot Translate creates a dedicated URL for each language to ensure the proper indexation of your translated content on search engines (Google, …). SEO tags are also translated and editable within your Weglot Translate account. Translated pages will each be located on a subdirectory.


= Translated URLs =

Weglot Translate does not translate URLs, as this could break URLs with non-Roman characters (for example, on sites in languages using theChinese or Cyrillic alphabets) and it has no proven impact on SEO. Rest assured: the internet’s biggest sites, likeGoogle, Amazon, Airbnb, etc… don’t do this, either.


= Translate images/videos =

With Weglot Translate, you can add different images for different languages. This is useful if you have text in an image and you want to display a “translated” image in your translated version. To do this, you can simply upload your other translated image into your WordPress gallery. Then, you can link it to the correct translated version of your site by going to your Weglot dashboard and searching for the original URL in the translations list; replace this URL with the newly-uploaded “translated” image’s URL in the translation column.


= Translation exclusions =

You can exclude pages, or parts of pages, from translation if you don’t want them to be translated, by using CSS selectors.
To do this, go into the WordPress admin panel --&gt; Weglot settings,and use the field « Translation Exclusion ».

= Translation exceptions =

You can create your own translation rules in your Weglot dashboard by clicking on Translation Options, allowing you to:

1. Add Exception Rules, such as « Never translate » or « Always translate » a word/expression in a custom way (for example, if you do not want to translate your brand name).
2. Use the « Search and Replace » tool to easily search for a word in all your translations and replace it with the one you want.


= Is Weglot Translate compatible with WooCommerce? =

Yes, you can use Weglot Translate to translate WooCommerce store sites without any compatibility issues. Even your checkout page is translated—and the translations are editable from your Weglot Translate dashboard.


= Support =

If you have any questions about Weglot Translate, please post a topic on the [support forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/weglot) or contact us at support@weglot.com.
